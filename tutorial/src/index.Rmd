# mlr Tutorial
This web page provides an in-depth introduction on how to
use the [%mlr] framework for machine learning experiments in **R**.

We focus on the comprehension of the basic functions and applications.
More detailed technical information can be found in the [manual pages](%mlr) which
are regularly updated and reflect the documentation of the [current package version on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr/index.html).

An offline version of this tutorial is available for download

* [here](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/release/mlr_tutorial.zip) for the
  current mlr release on CRAN
* and [here](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/devel/mlr_tutorial.zip) for
  the mlr devel version on Github.

The tutorial explains the basic analysis of a data set step by step.
Please refer to sections of the menu above: Basics, Advanced, Extend and Appendix.

During the tutorial we present various simple examples from classification, regression, cluster and
survival analysis to illustrate the main features of the package.

Enjoy reading!

## Quick start
A simple stratified cross-validation of [linear discriminant analysis](&MASS::lda) with [%mlr].
```{r}
library(mlr)
data(iris)

## Define the task
task = makeClassifTask(id = "tutorial", data = iris, target = "Species")

## Define the learner
lrn = makeLearner("classif.lda")

## Define the resampling strategy
rdesc = makeResampleDesc(method = "CV", stratify = TRUE)

## Do the resampling
r = resample(learner = lrn, task = task, resampling = rdesc, show.info = FALSE)

## Get the mean misclassification error
r$aggr
```
