# Style Guide

* Please write **R** when referring to R.
* Please write [%mlr] and [%package] referring to mlr or any other package. This will link to 
  rdocumentation.org.
* Links to performance measures should point to measures.md (for example `[mmce](measures.md)`).
* Links to functions: [function](&package::function)

## Headers

* Headers beginning with # are capitalized.
* Headers beginning with ##, ###, etc. are not capitalized.

## R code

* Comments in R code start with ## and the first word is capitalized. 
  No dot at the end except the comment is a proper sentence
