# Preprocessing Operators

Data preprocessing can be performed using the "mlrCPO" ("Composable Preprocessing Operators") addon package for mlr.
CPO makes it easy to use a variety of preprocessing operations, to chain different operations, and to integrate
preprocessing with mlr learners, and to define custom preprocessing operations.

To chain different operations, to apply a CPO to a dataset, and to attach a CPO to a learner, the operator `%>>%` can
be used. This way, it is possible to create natural looking pipelines that 

## CPO Objects

Different preprocessing operations are provided in the form of *CPO Constructors*, which can be called like functions
to create *CPO* objects. These CPO objects are then used to apply the operation to a data set.

The central operation 

```{r}
cpoScale  # a cpo constructor
cpoScale()  # create a CPO object that ca
